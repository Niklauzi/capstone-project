    "Capstone Project for Data Science - Tinyuka Session\n",
    "Project Overview\n",
    "In this capstone project, you will apply your data science and machine learning skills to develop a predictive model for house prices. This project will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. You will use a real-world dataset to build a model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features.\n",

    "Instruction Prompts\n",
    "Project Introduction\n",
    "Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices using a dataset containing various house-related features.\n",
    "Dataset: You will use the \"House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques\" dataset from Kaggle (or any other relevant house price dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preparation\n",
    "Task 1.1: Download the dataset from Kaggle or another source.\n",
    "Task 1.2: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "Task 1.3: Inspect the dataset for missing values and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "Task 1.4: Perform data cleaning to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Task 2.1: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features and the target variable (house prices).\n",
    "Task 2.2: Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.\n",
    "Task 2.3: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "Phase 3: Feature Engineering\n",
    "Task 3.1: Create new features that may help improve the model's performance.\n",
    "Task 3.2: Encode categorical variables using one-hot or label encoding techniques.\n",
    "Task 3.3: Normalize or standardize numerical features as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 4: Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "Task 4.1: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "Task 4.2: Choose and justify the selection of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).\n",
    "Task 4.3: Train multiple models and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, RÂ²).\n",
    "Task 4.4: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.\n",
    "Task 4.5: Select and evaluate the best-performing model on the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 5: Model Interpretation and Reporting\n",
    "Task 5.1: Interpret the results of the best-performing model and explain the importance of critical features.\n",
    "Task 5.2: Create visualizations to support your findings and model interpretations.\n",
    "Task 5.3: Write a comprehensive report summarizing the project, including the methodology, results, and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "Code: Submit the complete code used for data preparation, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation (Jupyter Notebook format)\n",
    "Report: Submit a detailed report (PDF or Jupyter Notebook format) documenting your approach, findings, and conclusions. The report should include visualizations and a clear explanation of your steps.\n",
    "Presentation: Prepare a brief presentation (5-10 slides) summarizing your project and key findings. You may be asked to present this to your peers or instructors.\n",
